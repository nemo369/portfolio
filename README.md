## About Me

I am a Frontend Web Developer with more than 3 experience in the latest web technologies.
My expertise ranges from *JavaScript(ES6)* frontend libraries such as *Angular, Vue and React*, all the way to pixel perfect development based on CSS 3&HTML 5.
As a self learner who is always on top of the latest technologies and innovations, I also do backend applications based on NodeJS and PHP, which results in beautiful full scale web apps.

## About this project
This website is developed & designed by me.
You can find the source code in Github. All the code, photos and design are open source so you are more then welcome to use them. I used React on top of [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) JS for the development and I used [Figma](figma.com) for the design. Hosted in Netlify
